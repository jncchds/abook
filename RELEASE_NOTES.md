# Release Notes

## v0.1.6 — 2026-05-08

- fix: chapter outlines not persisted after planning — replaced per-chapter `AddChapterAsync` loop with atomic `ReplaceChaptersAsync` (single DB transaction); a mid-loop failure can no longer leave the DB in a partially-saved state
- fix: planning streaming preview flashes empty briefly after completion — `plannerBuffer` is now cleared only after `refreshBook()` resolves (not before), so chapter cards appear directly without an intermediate empty state; also added `.catch` to always clear `runStatus` even on network errors

## v0.1.5 — 2026-05-08

- fix: chapters disappear after planning completes — `WorkflowProgress(isComplete=true)` now clears `runStatus` only AFTER `refreshBook()` resolves, so the "No chapters yet" empty state can never flash while chapters are still loading

## v0.1.4 — 2026-05-08

- fix: "Clear All" chapters button now works — `Chapter` TS interface gains `isArchived`, sidebar and Chapters list filter archived chapters out so they disappear visually after archiving
- feat: archive/restore individual chapters — 🗄 button on each chapter card in the Chapters list and in ChapterView header; archived chapters appear in a collapsible "Show archived" section with ♻ Restore and 📜 History buttons
- fix: version history (📜) now available for archived characters and plot threads in their "Show archived" sections

## v0.1.3 — 2026-05-08

- fix: complete `[JsonIgnore]` coverage on all reverse/parent navigation properties — added `Book.User`, `AppUser.ApiToken`, `CharacterCardVersion.CharacterCard`, `PlotThreadVersion.PlotThread`; also marks `AppUser.ApiToken` non-serializable for security


- fix: concurrent RAG queries caused EF Core "second operation" and identity-map key conflicts — `PgvectorVectorStoreService` now creates a fresh `DbContext` per operation via `IDbContextFactory`; `WriterAgent` and `EditorAgent` RAG queries are now sequential to prevent concurrent `SaveChangesAsync` on the shared scoped `BookRepository`
- fix: added `[JsonIgnore]` to all reverse navigation properties (`Book`, `Chapter`, `User` references and collection navprops on `Book`/`Chapter`) to prevent infinite dependency trees during serialization; also hide `PasswordHash` on `AppUser`

## v0.1.1 — 2026-05-08

- fix: chapter list and book list in the sidebar now scroll with the panel instead of having their own nested scrollbars

## v0.1.0 — 2026-05-08
